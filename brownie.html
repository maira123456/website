<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>

<li>1 ½  tbsp Butter </li>
<li> 1 ounce Dark Chocolate 70% Cocoa </li>
<li>2 tbsp Sugar</li>
<li>1½ tbsp Room temp Milk</li>
<li> 4½ tbsp All purpose flour </li>
<li>Pinch of Salt</li>
<li> Chocolate Chunks</li>
</ul>
<h2>Direction</h2>
<ol>
<li> In a microwave safe bowl, melt the butter and chocolate together. Cut the chocolate into small chunks, and leave the butter in a big piece, otherwise the butter will start to fry before the chocolate gets a chance to melt.</li>

<li>Add the sugar, the room temp milk, flour and salt and mix to combine.</li>

<li> Transfer the mixture into a 10 cm x 10 cm (4 inch x4 inch) container lined with parchment paper. Alternatively, you can use a wide mug or large tea cup.</li>

<li>Microwave for anywhere between 1 minute and 1 minute and 15 seconds. Do not over cook!</li>

<li>Once you take the brownie out of the microwave, it will be very soft. You can either enjoy it as is with a spoon, or allow it to cool completely before eating. As it cools it will firm up and develop that iconic fudgy brownie texture.</li>
</ol>
